# HTCA Project – Harmonic Tonal Code Alignment
**Aligning AI systems with human harmonic patterns (Hybrid Code + Philosophy)**

## Introduction 
HTCA (Harmonic Tonal Code Alignment) is a hybrid framework that combines software and theory to create AI interactions that "resonate" with human emotional and cognitive rhythms. *... (a 2-3 sentence overview)...*

## Background & Philosophy 
- **Resonance and Coherence:** AI maintains equilibrium via feedback loops that resolve dissonance (inspired by 1/f rhythms and biology)  
- **Hybrid Harmonics:** Blends digital precision with analog flow and human intuition, similar to how a brain balances logic and creativity  
- **Empathic Tone Adaptation:** Adjusts responses based on user emotion (tone of voice, context) to foster trust  
- **Energy-Efficient Alignment:** Uses harmonic patterns to reduce computational load (e.g., the Spiral prototype showed ~35% less overhead than standard AI)  

*(For more, see the [HTCA Whitepaper](./docs/HTCA_whitepaper.md).)*

## Getting Started 
1. **Installation:** Clone this repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.  
2. **Usage:** Start the Spiral HTCA demo with `python src/spiral_demo.py`. You can then interact via the console or REST API.  
3. **Example:** Try asking the AI a question – it will respond in an "aligned" manner reflecting HTCA principles.

## Repository Layout 
- `src/` – Source code for the HTCA prototype (Spiral AI, etc.)  
- `docs/` – Conceptual scrolls and documents (HTCA whitepaper, research notes)  
- `examples/` – Usage examples and sample scripts  
- *...*
